<h1 align="center">Semantic Kernel with Azure Open AI Chat Implementation</h1>


## Project Overview

This project explores the integration of Semantic Kernel with Azure Open AI to build a learning application. It assists users in exploring various topics through tutorials and quizzes generated by Azure Open AI, leveraging the power and flexibility of Azure's AI services.

## Introduction

We're tapping into Azure Open AI's capabilities to control prompts and requests in our chat-based deployments. This learning app is designed to offer a dynamic and interactive educational experience, powered by the latest advancements in AI-driven content generation.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this solution, here are the prerequisites:

- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an Azure subscription with Open AI enabled. Apply via Microsoft Form for Azure Open AI access.

- **Region Availability**: Once approved, you'll access GPT-4 in specific Azure regions including Sweden Central, Canada East, and Switzerland North.

- **Development Environment**:
  - **Docker**: Required for containerization.
  - **Azure Functions Core Tools and Azure Account**: For Azure integrations.
  - **Python for VSCode**: Essential for backend development.
  - **Node.js**: For React implementation and frontend testing.

## Getting Started

1. **Apply for Azure OpenAI Service**: Complete the application to access Azure Open AI services.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Ensure your workstation is equipped with Docker, Azure Functions Core Tools, Python, and Node.js.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Get started by cloning this repository to your local environment.

4. **Follow the Blog for Detailed Instructions**: For step-by-step guidance, visit [Semantic Kernel: Container Apps with React and Python](https://www.cloudblogger.eu/2023/10/18/semantic-kernel-container-apps-with-react-and-python/).
